Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science, now in my 5th semester at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University, Lucknow.
 My journey in tech began somewhat aimlessly until I had a pivotal realization in my first year that set me on a path of self-improvement.
<br />In my 3rd semester, I got my laptop and dove into learning Java and Web development. This ignited my passion for frontend development, particularly in designing websites/apps and products. To enhance my skills bit more, I learned Figma for UI/UX design and started solving DSA problems on LeetCode for sustain in rat race.
<br />By the end of my 2nd year, I had a clear vision for my career. I decided to make a significant impact in the tech industry and discovered my interest in the role of a Product Manager. Since then, I have been diligently preparing for this role while continuously honing my development and design skills.
I am committed to leveraging my knowledge and skills to innovate and drive meaningful change in the industry. <br /> My goal is to become a Product Manager and contribute to creating impactful products.
 <br />Thank you for taking the time to read my profile ðŸ’—
